3. **Data Preparation** – Clean, transform, and format data.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Extract useful features to improve model performance.
5. **Build & Train Model** – Select, train, and optimize machine learning algorithms.
6. **Test & Evaluate** – Validate model accuracy, precision, and recall.
7. **Model Deployment** – Deploy the trained model for real-world use.
8. **Monitoring & Optimization** – Track performance and retrain models when needed.

💡 *Example:* If a model performs below expectations, it may require **feature engineering improvements** or **hyperparameter tuning** before deployment.

---

## **3. Challenges in ML Model Deployment**
### **A. Data Challenges**
- **Data is scattered** across multiple databases and formats.
- **Data inconsistency** (missing values, duplicate records, noise).
- **3Vs of Data**: 
  - **Volume** (large datasets),
  - **Velocity** (data is constantly changing),
  - **Variety** (structured, unstructured data).  
- **Data Storage** issues in handling and managing large datasets.

### **B. Model Challenges**
- **Selecting the right model** for scalability and efficiency.

---
## **Objectives**
✅ Learn to create and activate virtual environments.
✅ Install dependencies and package ML models.
✅ Save trained ML models using pickling.
✅ Test and debug Python packages using `pytest`.
✅ Understand Python packaging and dependency management.

---
## **1️⃣ Virtual Environments**
A **virtual environment** isolates dependencies for different projects. This is helpful when different projects require different versions of the same package.

📌 **Install Virtual Environment:**  
```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

📌 **Create a Virtual Environment:**  
```sh
virtualenv venv_project
```

📌 **Activate Virtual Environment:**  
```sh
source venv_project/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv_project\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

📌 **Deactivate Virtual Environment:**  
```sh
deactivate
```

📌 **List Installed Packages:**  
```sh
pip list  # OR
pip freeze
```

---
## **2️⃣ Requirements File**
The `requirements.txt` file holds the list of dependencies required for a project.

📌 **Generate a requirements file:**  
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

📌 **Install dependencies from requirements file:**  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
## **3️⃣ Serializing & Deserializing ML Models**
Serialization (pickling) allows saving ML models for reuse. **Joblib** is a popular library for this purpose.

📌 **Install Joblib:**  
```sh
pip install joblib
```

📌 **Save ML Model:**  
```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
```

📌 **Load Saved Model:**  
```python
loaded_model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
```

---
## **4️⃣ Testing Python Code with Pytest**
Testing ensures that your package functions correctly before deployment.

📌 **Install Pytest:**  
```sh
pip install pytest
```

📌 **Run Pytest:**  
```sh
pytest -v
```

📌 **Example Test Case:**  
```python
import pytest

def test_sum():
    assert sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6
```

📌 **Output Indicators:**  
- ✅ `.` – Test Passed
- ❌ `F` – Test Failed
- ⚠️ `E` – Error Occurred

---
## **5️⃣ Python Packaging & Dependency Management**
Modularizing Python code helps improve maintainability and reusability.

📌 **Components of a Python Package:**
- `module.py`: A Python file containing functions/classes.
- `package/`: A directory with multiple modules.
- `__init__.py`: Marks a directory as a package.

📌 **Example Package Structure:**
```
📦 prediction_model/            # Root directory (ML Model Packaging)
│── 📜 MANIFEST.in             # File manifest for package distribution
